      <h1>Camping Site Full</h1>
      <p>The camping site, Het Scharrelnest, <strong>has reached its maximum capacity for Friday through Saturday, that
          is, Friday night.</strong> Jugglers without tickets will unfortunately need to find alternative accommodations
        for this night. These are the tickets: Full Festival, Thursday through Saturday, Friday through Sunday, and
        Friday + Saturday. <strong>For everyone with a pre-registration ticket, there is still space available, of
          course!</strong>!If there are any important updates, our social media channels and website will be updated as
        soon as possible.</p>

      <h1 id="about-njf-anchor">What is the NJF?</h1>
      <p>What is the Dutch Juggling Festival (NJF) really? Good question! Since 1990 people have come together in the
        Netherlands for their shared interest in juggling and other circus disciplines. The NJF is a four-day festival
        consisting of learning new tricks, playing games, watching shows and making friends. The location, theme and
        organisation team change each year but the period remains the same: the NJF always starts on Ascension Thursday
        and ends the following sunday. In 2024, the NJF will be from the 9th of May until the 12th of May. This time
        around in Wijchen, the 33rd edition of the NJF will be held. Enough to look back upon, therefore this year the
        NJF is coated in a vintage sauce. So put on your tracksuit, cover your eyes with old shades to look good for the
        polaroid!

      <p>In 2024 the NJF will take place in Wijchen! Wijchen is a city in the province of Gelderland, near Nijmegen.
        Sportscenter Arcus accommodates the NJF during four days, day and night! The hall is well connected via public
        transport: a 20 minute walk separates Arcus from train station Wijchen and there is a bus stop on site named
        Wijchen, Moza&iuml;ek. <br>

        Adress: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qNT7eeQYcvyKABvV8">Arcus, Campuslaan 14, 6602 HX Wijchen</a><br><br>

        This year, we'll be camping at Camping het Scharrelnest. <strong>This camping site is unfortunately full for
          Friday through Saturday, that is, on Friday night.</strong> It's just a short 10-minute walk from the venue;
        bringing skateboards, unicycles, and/or roller skates might be fun! Please note that showering at the campsite
        is not allowed. You can use the showers at Sports Center Arcus. For those travelling by car, please note that
        the five parking spaces at the campsite are only available for loading and unloading. Parking outside of the
        central area of Wijchen and in the car parks of Wijchen is free.<br>
