        <p>Tickets for the NJF 2024 are available <a
                href="https://tickets.stichtingnjf.nl/product-categorie/njf-2024/">here</a>! The tickets are available
            during different phases. The first phase runs from January 22nd until February 25th. The second phase runs
            from February 26th until April 28th. All tickets for Saturday include a Gala show ticket worth &euro;15. Be
            quick because this year we have a <b>limited number of camping spots</b>, so purchase a ticket for multiple
            days swiftly and secure yourself a spot at the campsite. The earlier you buy your ticket, the more discount
            you get! This also gives the organization a good insight into the expected number of visitors, allowing them
            to shape the festival as well as possible. Note that there is no breakfast on Thursday and no dinner on
            Sunday, due to the start and end times of the NJF.</p>

        <h2>The Support ticket</h2>
        <p>This year, we are introducing the Support ticket, a special kind of ticket that contributes to keeping the
            festival accessible and affordable for everyone. Additionally, purchasing this ticket helps make the
            festival even more special and amazing. For instance, it could enable us to book that one awesome gala show
            artist. The price of the Support ticket varies depending on when you buy it. During the first phase of
            ticket sales, the ticket is available for &euro;135. After the first phase, the ticket is available for
            &euro;145. It is also possible to donate more.</p>

        <h2>Circusworkshop for Children</h2>
        <p>On May 11th, the NJF is organizing a morning especially for 6 to 14 year olds! You are welcome at
            Sportcentrum Arcus to come and join a workshop between 10:00 and 12:00. During these two hours, you will get
            a taste of many different circus disciplines. After 12:00, we invite you to participate in our additional
            program: at 12:30, a parade full of jugglers will depart from the sports hall towards the market. At the
            market, you can immediately apply the tricks you've just learned at our Juggling Games! This is a public
            event where jugglers showcase all their tricks for fun prizes. After the games, we hope to see you at 15:30
            in theater &apos;t Moza&iuml;ek. Here, you will be entertained for an hour by various top artists from the
            circus world. One ticket for this gala show is also included in the workshop ticket! Are there more people
            who want to join? Individual performance tickets are also available for purchase! Click <a
                href="https://tickets.stichtingnjf.nl/product/njf24-workshop-jeugd/">here</a> to be directed straight to
