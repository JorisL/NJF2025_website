        <p>
          The NJF is organized at a different location each year. The organized team also
          changes each year. Below, the 2025 team introduces itself.

          When I was fourteen, I met a girl at summer camp who did circus. I was so fascinated
          by this that I wanted to join youth circus myself. So it is no surprise what my choice
          was when my father wanted me to take up a sport. Already after the first trial lesson I
          was sold and since then I have never stopped doing circus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I am not a juggler, as an acrobat I also always feel at home at Juggling
          Festivals. Because of the open atmosphere, there is also plenty of room for me to
          train and meet new people.

          I started juggling as a student, after I was invited to join the 2013 NJF in Houten.
          Since then, juggling has become a big hobby, and I have gone to many dozens of
          juggling conventions in the Netherlands and Europe. Thanks to friends I met through
          these conventions I also started unicycling. On my unicycle I can now regularly be
          found on local mountain bike trails, and have made trips in the Swiss Alps and the
          Scottish Highlands, among other places.

        <p>
          I was 11 when I was first introduced to circus through my elementary school. Not long
          after, I enrolled in the youth circus in Etten-Leur. That's where my passion for juggling
          and related disciplines was born, juggling and unicycling being my favorite parts. I still
          train weekly with great pleasure!
        </p>
        <p>
          At the festivals I was often a day visitor. My first full festival was only the 2018 NJF in
          Amersfoort. However, there I found out that the experience is totally different when
          you are there for the whole weekend. So since then, I have been coming to festivals
          more often. I look forward to putting down a fun edition of the NJF this year with this
          team.

          When I was in 8th grade, the diabolo was a thing of craze at my elementary school.
          Later, when my sister started playing with the diabolo, I started doing the same. I
          enjoyed practicing the diabolo so much that I didn't stop doing it after the fad. A few
          months later I bought my first professional diabolos at the circus store in Rotterdam.
          This circus store informed me that there was a Juggling Festival, called the NJF, in
          Vlaardingen this year (2010). I went there and since then I visit all kinds of Juggling
          Festivals mainly in the Netherlands, but also the rest of Europe.

          I started juggling at the age of ten. Because I juggled so much at home, my parents
          signed me up for a circus camp. Since then, juggling has been one of my biggest
          hobbies. So a few years later I started joining circus club Giraffe. This club organized
          an annual juggling day. So I attended my first juggling festival. I liked it so much that I
          started visiting more and more festivals. First within the Benelux, but later also in the
          rest of Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          After visiting many festivals, in 2012 I organized for the first time a Juggling
          Convention in Kortrijk. Meanwhile, I have already organized seven editions of the
          Skjeve Convention. All this knowledge comes in handy when organizing the Dutch
          Juggling Convention.
