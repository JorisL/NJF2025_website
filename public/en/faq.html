        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>When does the NJF start?</h2>
        <p>The NJF begins on Thursday, May 29th.</p>

        <h2>Is the NJF location easily accessible by public transportation?</h2>
        <p>Yes indeed. Look for directions at <a href="location.html#route">Location</a>.</p>

        <h2>Can I stay overnight at the NJF?</h2>
        <p>
          The NJF lasts four days and best of all: you don't have to her home at night! There is
          a campsite a few minutes from the sports hall. If you have a full festival ticket or
          tickets for several days, you can stay overnight at this campsite in between. Just
          make sure you have your own tent or camper.
        </p>

        <h2>I have a camper/caravan. Can I enter the site with it?</h2>
        <p>
          We have separate spaces for campers and caravans in the parking lot next to the
          sports hall. Please let us know when you register to ensure a spot for your caravan or
          camper.
        </p>

        <h2>Can I arrive earlier than May 29 or stay longer than June 1?</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, it is not possible to arrive earlier as a visitor. However, we are looking
          for volunteers to help us build on May 28. For these pre-registered volunteers we
          provide a place to stay overnight. Would you like to help with this? Send an email to
          <a href="mailto:2025@nederlandsjongleerfestival.nl">2025@nederlandsjongleerfestival.nl</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Is food included during the festival?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Are you coming to stay overnight during the festival? Then your breakfast and dinner
          are included in the ticket. So you only need to take care of some snacks. You can get
          these at various supermarkets in the area or at the sports bar in the sports hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are attending the NJF for a day, you can choose a ticket with or without dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          For tickets at the door, we offer dinner while supplies last. Want to be assured of a
          hot meal? Then pre-order your ticket online.
        </p>

        <h2>I have a food allergy. Can the catering take this into account for dinner?</h2>
        <p>
          During the NJF all the food is vegetarian. In addition, you can indicate at your
          registration if you eat vegan, so we can take this into account for dinner. Do you have
          a food allergy? Please mention this on the registration form. We will pass on all
          allergies to the caterer so that they can be taken into account.
        </p>

        <h2>My son/daughter would like to come to the NJF for a day. Do I also have to buy a ticket?</h2>
        <p>
          How very nice that your son, daughter, grandchild, or perhaps a friend wants to
          participate in the Dutch Juggling Festival (NJF)! The NJF welcomes jugglers of all
          ages, and there is something for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an attendant or spectator you can join us with a spectator ticket. This ticket gives
          you access to the sports canteen of Sporthal de Zeine, where you can relax with a
          drink from the bar. Participants under the age of 16 must always have an attendant
          present, so you are expected to stay in the sports hall. Feel free to bring a book or
          laptop and enjoy the cozy atmosphere. Through the large windows in the cafeteria
          you can see what is happening in the juggling hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Important to know:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spectator tickets are available if the participant is at least 12 years old and can
              juggle independently. This is important because juggling is an activity where
              many objects fly through the air, and we want to maintain a safe environment
              for all visitors.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the participant is younger than 12 years old or finds it difficult to train
              independently, we ask an adult to purchase a day ticket. With a day ticket you
              have access to the venue and can juggle or support together as needed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Do I have to bring my own juggling equipment?</h2>
        <p>
          During the Dutch Juggling Convention, everyone brings their own props and
          materials. Don't have them? No problem, <a href="https://www.circus-expert.com//">Circus-Expert</a> is also this year at the festival
          with a stand. Here you can try out and buy new material!
        </p>

        <h2>Can I bring my pet to NJF?</h2>
        <p>
          No matter how sweet your dog, cat or hamster is, you should still leave it at home or
          arrange a place to stay. Animals, with the exception of guide dogs and assistance
          dogs, are not allowed on the convention site, including camping.
        </p>

        <h2>Is participation at your own risk?</h2>
        <p>
          From the moment you enter the NJF grounds, this is entirely at your own risk. This
          applies to practicing juggling disciplines as well as floor and aerial acrobatics. We
          therefore ask participants to only practice acrobatics if they have done it before or are
          familiar with catching techniques. In other cases, we ask participants to practice floor
          and aerial acrobatics only during beginner workshops. See our
          <a href="https://tickets.stichtingnjf.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Terms-and-Conditions-Dutch-Juggling-Convention-v1.3.pdf"> Terms and Conditions</a>
          for more information.
